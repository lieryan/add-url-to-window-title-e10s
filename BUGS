1. FIXED when refreshing, you'd see doubled URLs
2. FIXED pages that sets titles via document.title (e.g. Google Instant Search)
3. when the addon is reinstalled, you'd see doubled URLs
4. the addon should restore titles when uninstalled
5. non-HTML pages
6. we modify the prototype of Document to catch title modifications, this is
   probably bad for JIT optimizers
7. if addon was just installed, back button to old page doesn't set title

Solution:
1. add a getter/setter to document.title
   1. getter should retrieve displayTitle
   2. setter should set realTitle and then call titleUpdate()
   3. titleUpdate() should generate displayTitle based on realTitle and the
      current page's url
